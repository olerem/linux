= NVMEM in MTD =

Config data for drivers, like MAC addresses, is often stored in MTD.
This binding define how such data storage can be represented in device tree.

An MTD can be defined as an NVMEM provider by adding the `nvmem-provider`
property to their node. Data cells can then be defined as child nodes
of the partition as defined in nvmem.txt.

Required properties:
nvmem-provider:	Indicate that the device should be registered as
		NVMEM provider

Example:

	flash@0 {
		...

		partition@2 {
			label = "art";
			reg = <0x7F0000 0x010000>;
			read-only;

			nvmem-provider;
			#address-cells = <1>;
			#size-cells = <1>;

			eeprom@1000 {
				label = "wmac-eeprom";
				reg = <0x1000 0x1000>;
			};
		};
	};
